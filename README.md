## Introduction: Recognizing and Valuing Name Diversity

Personal names are fundamental to identity, yet naming conventions vary dramatically across cultures and languages. The often-unspoken assumption of a universal Western first-middle-last name structure can lead to misunderstandings and a lack of respect for individual preferences.

The **Names Acknowledgment System (NAS)** offers a simple and adaptable framework to clearly represent name structures and individual preferences for address, promoting greater understanding and respect in all interactions.

## Core Components of NAS Notation

The NAS notation is placed in parentheses immediately following a person's full name:

* **n** = name(s) / given name(s)
* **s** = surname(s) / family name(s)
* **.** (point) = Separator between distinct units of a name (individual given names or surnames).
* **N** = Preferred given name(s) or the initial(s) of the preferred given name(s).
* **S** = Preferred surname(s).
* **-** (hyphen) = Connects parts of a single name or surname unit treated as one for preference or cultural reasons (e.g., multi-character given names, hyphenated names).
* **--** (double hyphen) = Indicates a longer multi-part unit acting as a single name or surname component.
* **t** = Title or honorific (used when relevant to formal identification).

## Understanding NAS: Structure and Preference

The NAS notation provides two key pieces of information: the order of given names and surnames within the full name, and the individual's preferred name(s) for address (indicated by capitalization).

* **Basic Structure:** Lowercase `n` and `s` separated by points delineate the sequence of given names and surnames.
   * Example: Paulina Andrea Valenzuela Lagos **(n.n.s.s.)**

* **Indicating Preference:** Capitalizing `N` and `S` signifies the name(s) the individual prefers to be addressed by, especially in formal contexts.
   * Example: Paulina Andrea Valenzuela Lagos **(N.n.S.S.)** (Prefers "Paulina" and both surnames)
   * Example: John David Smith **(N.n.S.)** (Prefers "John Smith")
   * Example: Nai Yun Blanca Hsiao **(N-.n.S.)** (Prefers "Nai Yun" and "Hsiao")
   * Example: Nguyễn Thao Thách Minh **(S.N.n.n)** (Prefers "Nguyễn" and "Thao")

* **Combined Name Units:** The hyphen `-` groups parts of a name that function as a single unit due to cultural conventions or individual preference.
   * Example: Eun-jung Lee **(n-.s.)**
   * Example: 范寶琳 **(s.n-.)** (Surname with one character, given name with two)

* **Extended Name Units:** The double hyphen `--` signifies a longer, multi-part component treated as one unit.
   * Example: 小泉 純一郎 **(s-.n--)**

* **Titles:** `t` is used to denote a title, with capitalization within the name showing preferred usage.
   * Example: King Charles Philip Arthur George **(t.N.n.n.n.)**

## Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to common questions about NAS can be found in [FAQ.md](faq.md).

## Practical Application of NAS

Integrating NAS can improve communication and respect in various settings:

* **Email Signatures:** Include your NAS notation for clarity.
   * Example: Jane Marie Smith Johnson (N.n.S.S.)

* **Publications:** Add NAS notation to author listings for accurate representation.
   * Example: Jane Marie Smith Johnson (N.n.S.S.)¹, ...

* **Conferences/Events:** Offer an optional NAS field on registration materials.

## Respectful Address Using NAS

When you see a name with NAS notation:

* Prioritize the name components indicated by **capitalization** (`N` and `S`).
* In general conversation, using the preferred given name(s) (`N`) is usually appropriate.
* In formal contexts or when unsure, use the preferred given name(s) followed by the preferred surname(s).
